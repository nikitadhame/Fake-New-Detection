7. **TF-IDF Vectorizer**


## Project Overview

In the digital age, fake news can spread rapidly. This project aims to build a machine learning model that classifies news articles as real or fake based on their textual content.
The model was trained using a dataset of labeled news headlines and bodies, with text processing techniques like TF-IDF, and classification using Logistic Regression.


## Dependencies

Before running the code, make sure you have the following libraries and packages installed:

- Python 3
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Regular Expression

You can install these dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install matplotlib
pip install sklearn
pip install seaborn 
pip install re 
```



## Results

The model achieved good accuracy on the test set. It can be further improved using:

1.**More complex models (e.g., Random Forest, BERT)**
2.**Better text preprocessing**
3.**Larger and more diverse datasets**


## Future Improvements:
1.**Use deep learning models like LSTM or BERT**
2.**Build a web interface using Flask or Streamlit**
3.**Add real-time news checking via an API**
